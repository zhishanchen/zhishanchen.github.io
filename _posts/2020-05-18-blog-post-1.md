Heritability
======
From: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/inheritance/heritability.  
Heritability is a measure of how well differences in people’s genes account for differences in their traits. In scientific terms, heritability is a statistical concept (represented as h²) that describes how much of the variation in a given trait can be attributed to genetic variation.Heritability estimates range from zero to one. A heritability close to zero indicates that almost all of the variability in a trait among people is due to environmental factors, with very little influence from genetic differences.
