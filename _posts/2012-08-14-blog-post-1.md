Data processing in R
======

Apply Family
======
These functions will apply a specified function to a data object and their primary difference is in the object class in which the function is applied to (list vs. matrix, etc) and the object class that will be returned from the function. 

* apply() for matrices and data frames   
* lapply() for lists…output as list  
* sapply() for lists…output simplified   
* tapply() for vectors   

Aren't headings cool?
