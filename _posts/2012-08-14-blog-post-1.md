This is a post with useful several functions in R, most of them are refered by http://uc-r.github.io/. These functions can make data processing more effective.

Data processing in R
======

Read file
======

From Excel and import into R. For mac, fristly select and copy the data. Then use the following command.
```
my_data <- read.table(pipe("pbpaste"), sep="\t", header = TRUE)
```

======

Apply Family
======
These functions will apply a specified function to a data object and their primary difference is in the object class in which the function is applied to (list vs. matrix, etc) and the object class that will be returned from the function. 

* apply() for matrices and data frames   
* lapply() for lists…output as list  
* sapply() for lists…output simplified   
* tapply() for vectors   

split
======
This function can be use to transform matrix (or data.frame) to list defined by vector. For example,
 
 ```
 mirna3<-split(mirna2[,2:401], mirna2$miRNA)
 ```
 Here, mirna2 is a matrix, the first column is the miRNA ids, and other columns are the expression value of this miRNA in each sample. We expected to divid the matrix to a list based on miRNA ids and then calculate mean for each miRNA ids.

Aren't headings cool?
