This is a post listing the commands that I use frequently.

bash
======

Install R package in bash
```
R CMD INSTALL --build MASS_7.3-51.6.tar.gz
```
Remove lines based on duplicates
```
awk '!seen[$3]++' filename
```

Sed
======

view lines from 5 to 10
```
sed -n '5,10p' filename
```
delete line 2 or lines 2 to 10
```
sed '2d' file
sed '2,10d' file
```

Print the line number or/and number of line matching a pattern
======

NR starts at 1
```
awk '{print NR-1 "," $0}'
```

Many tools can be handy (from https://unix.stackexchange.com/)

grep
```
grep -n 'bla' file
```

awk:
```
awk '/bla/{print NR":"$0}' file
```

perl
```
perl -ne 'print $.,":",$_ if /bla/' file
```

sed
```
sed '/bla/!d;=' file |sed 'N;s/\n/:/'
```
